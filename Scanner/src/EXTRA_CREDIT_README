The purpose of this README is to define the structure of two of the extra credit tokens
NOTE: * denotes zero or more
			^ denotes one or more

The paren comment is defined as: COMMENT:= LPAREN TIMES <characters>* TIMES RPAREN

The paren comment behaves exactly as the comment defined in assignment description. So any questions
about it should be refered to there.

Scientific Real Numbers are defined as: REAL:=<int> DOT <int>^ e <int>^
																						:=<int> DOT <int>^ e MINUS <int>^

For more specific information on how this is accomplished please see the inline comments in
TokenReader.java
