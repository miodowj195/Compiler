Description
</h2>
<p>
You are to implement a lexical scanner
and symbol table for Pascal.
<p>
Pascal is a programming language that was designed
by Nicklaus Wirth in the late 1960s
and that has had a significant influence
on several modern programming languages.
A detailed description of the lexical properties of Pascal
is given below.
<p>
A <em>lexical scanner</em> breaks up a program &mdash;
actually just a stream of characters &mdash;
into a stream of <em>tokens</em>,
which correspond to units of information
such as identifiers, constants, reserved words, and operators.
A <em>symbol table</em> is a device
for associating certain tokens
(e.g. identifiers)
with values and/or properties.
<p>
Your program should read in a text file
and write out a list of all the Pascal tokens appearing in it,
in the order in which they appear in the file.
For each token,
the output should appear on one line in the form
<blockquote>
line no.  tokenid  "display value"
</blockquote>
where 'line no.' is the number of the line
on which the token <em>begins</em>,
'tokenid' is the value of the token class
(an <code>enum</code> value, as described later),
and 'display value' is the string of characters
representing the value of the token.
The notion of 'display value' will be made more specific later.
The display value should be printed surrounded by double quotes.
<p>
After printing the list of tokens described above,
your program should print a cross-reference
of all identifiers.
This cross-reference should list all identifiers
in alphabetical order
and with each identifier
a list of line numbers on which the identifier appears.
The line numbers should be in ascending order
and should not have any repetitions.
Lists of line numbers that cannot fit on a 72-character line
should be folded onto the next line,
aligned with the line numbers above it.
Format your output to conform to the output produced
by the reference implementation described below.
<p>
Identifiers should be printed left-justified on a line
in a field width of 30 characters.
Although your scanner should not limit the number
of characters in an identifier,
for printing purposes you should truncate long identifiers
so they will fit into a 30-character field width.
Specifically, if an identifier has fewer than 30 characters,
simply print it left-justified in the 30-character field.
If an identifier has 30 or more characters,
print the first 29 characters of the identifier
followed by a plus sign (+) to indicate that it's a "long" identifier;
the resulting display will fit exactly in a 30-character field.
The printf specification for a left-justified 30-character string field
is "%-30s".
<p>
Each line number cross-reference entry should be printed
right-justified in a field of width 6:
the first character of the field should be a space,
and the remaining 5 characters should be the digits of the line number.
The printf specification for this is " %5d".
This can accommodate line numbers up to 99999,
which should be sufficient for most programs.
<p>
Since the identifier field has size 30
and each of the line number cross-reference entries takes up six digits,
a line can accommodate exactly seven cross-reference entries
to reach the limit of 72 characters on a line.
Thus, if there are more than seven cross-reference entries
for a particular identifier,
you will need to go to a new line, print a field of 30 spaces,
and then start printing the additional cross-reference entries.
Your program should accommodate any number of cross-reference entries
for any particular identifier.
<p>
In implementing your scanner,
it is strongly recommended
that you fully debug the lexical scanner
(the <code>read()</code> method
and associated finite state machine)
before you start on the symbol table.
The symbol table must be implemented
using a Java <code>Map</code> structure.
To alphabetize your identifiers,
you should use <code>Arrays.sort()</code>.
<h2>
Specifications
</h2>
<p>
A Pascal <strong>token</strong> is one of the following:
<ol>
<p><li>
<strong>Any of the following single-character symbols:</strong>
<blockquote><pre>
+ - * / = &lt; &gt; ( ) [ ] . , ; : ^
</pre></blockquote>
<p><li>
<strong>Any of the following two-character symbols:</strong>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;&gt;  &lt;=  &gt;=  ..  :=
</pre></blockquote>
<p><li>
<strong>Any reserved word:</strong>
<table>
<tr><td>and<td>array<td>begin<td>case<td>const
<tr><td>do<td>downto<td>div<td>else<td>end
<tr><td>file<td>for<td>function<td>goto<td>if
<tr><td>in<td>label<td>mod<td>nil<td>not
<tr><td>of<td>or<td>otherwise<td>packed<td>procedure
<tr><td>program<td>record<td>repeat<td>set<td>then<td>
<tr><td>to<td>type<td>until<td>var<td>while
<tr><td>with<td><td><td><td>
</table>
<p>
[Note that 'otherwise' is not a reserved word
in Jensen-Wirth Pascal.
Also, ISO Standard Pascal may have a few reserved words not in this list.]
<p><li>
<strong>Identifier:</strong>
a sequence of letters, digits and underscores '<samp>_</samp>'
starting with a letter, excluding reserved words.
<p>
[ISO Standard Pascal does not allow underscores in identifiers.]
<p><li>
<strong>Unsigned integer:</strong>
a sequence of one or more decimal digits.
[ISO Standard Pascal permits signed integers (and reals).]
<p><li>
<strong>Real number:</strong>
a sequence of one or more decimal digits followed by a decimal point
(<samp>.</samp>) followed by another sequence of one or more decimal digits.
Neither sequence of digits may be empty.
<p>
[You may ignore reals in scientific notation, such as <samp>1.0E+22</samp>.]
<p><li>
<strong>Quoted string:</strong>
a sequence of zero or more printable characters delimited
by single quote (<samp>'</samp>) symbols.
A printable character is one whose ASCII encoding
is in the range 32 to 127.
<p>
A single quote within a quoted string is represented
as two adjacent quote symbols.
A quoted string may not cross line boundaries,
and must be terminated with a closing quote.
<p>
[ISO Standard Pascal does not permit empty quoted strings.]
<p><li>
<strong>Error string:</strong>
a character sequence beginning with a single
quote but not terminating before a newline or end-of-file.
<p><li>
<strong>Comment:</strong>
a character sequence beginning with an open brace '{'
and ending with a closing brace '}'.
The comment ends with the first closing brace following the open brace.
Comments may cross line boundaries.
<p>
[ISO Standard Pascal also allows comments
within <code>(*</code> and <code>*)</code> pairs.]
<p><li>
<strong>Error comment:</strong>
a character sequence beginning with an open
brace '{' but not terminating before an end-of-file.
<p><li>
<strong>End-of-file:</strong>
this token is returned when the end
of the input file is reached.
The display value of this token is the string '*EOF*'.
<p><li>
<strong>Error:</strong>
this token is returned when a token is not of any of the
above forms
(e.g., the ampersand '<samp>&amp;</samp>' would be an error token).
</ol>
<p>
As stated,
this definition is ambiguous,
since it is posible that the string
<blockquote><pre>
ab12
</blockquote></pre>
could be considered as the identifier token '<samp>ab</samp>'
followed by the integer token '<samp>12</samp>',
or as one identifier token, '<samp>ab12</samp>'.
To resolve this ambiguity,
<em>a token is always taken
to be the longest sequence of characters possible
satisfying the definitions given above.</em>
<p>
Except in comments and strings,
whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines) is not part
of any token and should be skipped.
Note tabs and newlines (which are not printable characters)
cannot belong to a string,
but a space character (with ASCII code 32) is considered printable
and can appear in strings.
<p>
The Java class <code>Token</code>
is already defined for you in the file
<samp><a href="../../Examples/Scanner/Help/Token.java">
Token.java</a></samp>.
This class includes an <code>enum Val</code> class
that enumerates all of the values of the tokens
(with their obvious relationships with the definitions given above),
and defines fields that give
the token value (<code>val</code>),
the display string (<code>str</code>) of the token
as a <code>StringBuffer</code>,
and the integer line number (<code>lno</code>)
that the token starts on.
Line numbers start at one.
<p>
To start you off,
consult the directory
<blockquote>
<a href="../../Examples/Scanner/Help">
<samp>/home/student/Classes/463/Examples/Scanner/Help</samp>
</a>
</blockquote>
This directory contains the definition of the Token class
along with skeleton TokenReader and Scanner classes.
See the README file in this directory for guidance
about what do do with the Java files in this directory.
<p>
Your project should define a <code>TokenReader</code> class
that implements the <code>StreamReader&lt;Token&gt;></code> interface.
The <code>StreamReader&lt;Token&gt;</code> interface
defines a single method <code>read()</code>.
In the case of an instance of <code>TokenReader</code>,
repeated calls to its <code>read()</code> method will
return the Pascal tokens in the given file,
one-by-one,
until you reach end-of-file.
<p>
For a given token,
you can extract the token value,
the display string of the token,
and the token line number
by accessing the appropriately named public fields of the Token class.
<p>
You should create a <code>Scanner</code> class
in a file <code>Scanner.java</code>
that has a <code>main</code> method
The <code>main()</code> method
will create a <code>TokenReader</code> instance
that takes its input from standard input
and that will repeatedly call its <code>read()</code> method
until an end-of-file token is found,
printing the tokens line-by-line as they are read,
in the format described above.
After all tokens have been processed,
a cross-reference table should be printed,
preceded by a blank line and the following two header lines:
<pre>
Identifier Cross Reference Table
--------------------------------
</pre>
If there are no identifiers in the input file,
you should <em>not</em> print the blank line or the header lines.
<p>
The list of token names can be found in the <code>enum</code> class
given in the <samp>Token.java</samp> file.
<p>
Note that each token name identified in the <samp>Token.java</samp> file
has a print name that is the same as the name of the token
in the <code>enum</code> list.
For example, the following code will print "ADD":
<blockquote>
<pre>
Token.Val val = Token.Val.ADD;
System.out.println(val.toString());
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Your scanner class file executable should be called <samp>Scanner</samp>.
It should take its input from standard input,
and produce its output (the token list and symbol table) to standard output.
<h2>
Test files
</h2>
<p>
You should create a collection of test files
that illustrate the behavior of your scanner.
Taken together, these test files should exercise all aspects
of your scanner,
including correctly recognizing all tokens
and properly displaying the scanner output.
<p>
Pay particular attention to things like
distinguishing between one- and two-character tokens,
properly handling reals vs. integers,
dealing with quotes inside of strings,
and formatting your cross-reference list.
Just one test file will almost certainly not be sufficient
to test everything.
Your project grade will depend in part
on the quality of your test files.
<h2>
Documentation
</h2>
You are expected to follow the
<a href="../../Notes/documentation.html">
documentation guidelines
</a>
for internal and external documentation.
<h2>
Submission
</h2>
You should develop your code, test files, and documentation
in an appropriate working directory
that is dedicated to this project.
Include a <samp>README</samp> file in this directory
to identify your code, documentation, and test files
and to point out anything of interest to the grader.
Do not put items in this subdirectory that do not directly relate
to this project.
<p>
Let's assume that your working directory is called <samp>Scanner</samp>
and that it's a subdirectory of the directory
<samp>/home/student/&lt;login&gt;/463</samp>,
where <samp>&lt;login&gt;</samp> is your login name.
In the <samp>463</samp> directory,
create a tar file of your <samp>Scanner</samp> directory as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
tar cf Scanner.tar Scanner
</pre></blockquote>
Submit this tar file using the command
<blockquote><pre>
submit 463 Scanner.tar
</pre></blockquote>.
<h2>
Reference Implementation
</h2>
<p>
You can find a reference implementation of the scanner program
in a .jar file in the directory
<blockquote>
<a href="../../Examples/Scanner/Scantest"
<samp>/home/student/Classes/463/Examples/Scanner/Scantest</samp>
</a>
</blockquote>
The following command will run this program:
<blockquote>
<pre>
java -jar scanner.jar
</pre>
</blockquote>
You may redirect standard input from a file,
so that if you wanted to run the reference implementation
on a file named sort.p, you would do this:
</blockquote>
The following command will run this program
with input from the file <code>sort.p</code>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
java -jar scanner.jar < sort.p
</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>
The output of your program should be identical
to the output of the reference implementation.
</strong>
<p>
If you want to run the reference implementation in a different directory,
copy both the <samp>scanner.jar</samp> and <samp>463.jar</samp> files
into that directory and then execute the following command:
<blockquote><pre>
java -jar scanner.jar
</pre></blockquote>
This will read from standard input, which you can redirect
from a file as shown above.
<h2>
Assumptions
</h2>
<p>
Reserved words may be in any mixture of upper- and lower-case,
so that (for example)
"<tt>BEGIN</tt>",
"<tt>begin</tt>",
and 
"<tt>bEgIn</tt>"
are all equivalent.
<p>
Identifers are case-sensitive,
so that (for example)
"<tt>EG</tt>" and "<tt>eg</tt>"
are separate identifiers.
<p>
The display value of a reserved word,
a one- or two-character symbol
or an identifier
is the print-string of that token,
i.e. its lexeme.
The display value of a reserved word
should be converted to all uppercase.
<p>
The display value of an unsigned integer or of a real number
is the print string of that number.
<p>
The display value of a quoted string is the string
stripped of the leading and trailing quotes
and replacing internal double quotes <samp>''</samp>
with single quotes.
<p>
The display value of a comment
is the text between the open and closing braces up to
(but not including) the first end-of-line marker.
<p>
The display value of an error token is the offending character.
The display value of the end-of-file token
is the print string "<samp>*EOF*</samp>".
<p>
You should not assume the input to your <samp>scan</samp> program
is a legal Pascal program,
just that it is a sequence of tokens.
However, there are two "real" Pascal programs in the directory
<blockquote>
<a href="../../Examples/Scanner/Scantest">
<samp>/home/student/Classes/463/Examples/Scanner/Scantest</samp>
</a>
</blockquote>
that you can use to test your program.
<p>
Any additional assumptions you make should be clearly stated
in your documentation and should be reasonable and justified.
<h2>
Output
</h2>
<p>
The output should be a sequence of lines as described above,
followed by the identifier cross-reference table.
As noted, you should not print a cross-reference header
if there are no identifiers to be printed.
<h2>
Hints on development
</h2>
<p>
Start with the scanner code in the scanner
<a href="../../Examples/Scanner/Help"><tt>Help</tt></a> directory.
Decide on your FSM states early in the development cycle.
Your choices may profoundly affect your coding.
Do not carry out the following steps
until you have previous work done and tested:
<ol>
<li>
distinguishing between identifiers and reserved words
<li>
handling one- and two-character tokens
<li>
distinguishing between integers and reals
<li>
handling quoted strings
<li>
handling comments
<li>
building the cross-reference lists
for identifiers
<li>
sorting the identifiers and printing the cross-reference table
</ol>
<h2>
Extra credit
</h2>
<p>
You may add the following features for extra credit:
<ol>
<li>
reals in scientific notation
(see the ISO Pascal documentation to see
how these are defined)
<li>
Comments of the form <samp>(* . . . *)</samp>
</ol>
