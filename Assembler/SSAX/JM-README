This folder contains the source files and dependancies of
the assembler. Additionally it also contians a folder of 
test sax programs that were used in the testing of the assembler.


  File:
        Eval.java - Class used for the evaluation of expressions used 
                    by the program.  
                    
        Optab.java- Essentially at class used to store a Map of all the
                    compiler opcodes that are used in sax programs.

        Sax.java  - The body of the program. sax programs get assembled 
                    through this program, and have object modules, listing
                    files, and cross reference lists produced as a result
                        - KNOWN BUGS:
                           1. Does not handle DW directives 'pretty'
                              in the listing file all the time
                           2. Does not handle labels (local or otherwise)
                              that do not appear in label position in the 
                              cross reference table. Additionally, it does
                              does not place a '*' next to label line 
                              numbers if they defined on that line.
     Scanner.java - File used for directly consuming token.
 TokenReader.java - Class which is called by Scanner, to handle incoming
                    characters, and convert them to their appropriate
                    tokens.
       Token.java - A class defining the fields and properties of a token
                    as well as a enum of all the types of Vals.
          
       Test/      - A folder contianing sample sax programs usesd to test
                    Sax.java during development.
